# Problem Statement
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, offers bikes for short-term use through a computer-controlled docking system. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the company has experienced significant revenue losses and is struggling to maintain its business. To prepare for a recovery post-lockdown, BoomBikes aims to understand the demand for shared bikes once the pandemic subsides. They have contracted a consulting firm to identify the key factors affecting bike demand in the American market. With a dataset of daily bike usage based on various meteorological and lifestyle factors, the company seeks to determine which variables significantly predict bike demand and how well these variables explain it, to help strategize for future growth.



## Objective
You are tasked with modeling the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables. The model will help management understand how demand fluctuates with various features, enabling them to adjust their business strategy to align with customer expectations. Additionally, it will serve as a valuable tool for exploring the demand dynamics in new markets.


## Conclusions
- The most significant factor that affects the demand is temperature
- The demand increases as the year progresses from January to December. 
- There is a significant Y-o-Y growth in the demand for shared bikes.
- The demand for shared bikes goes down significantly during spring & during rains/thunderstorms/snow
